# bugs and issues

When trying to test the triangle function, test #8 didn't pass, but it seems like there's no difference between "what I expected" and "what I got". I don't know why this is happening.

# resolved issue 

Then I looked carefully at my code and realized the problem was that there was a space behind the "*," which was not supposed to appear. So I need to strip the space for every line.
